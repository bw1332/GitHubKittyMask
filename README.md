# GitHub Kitty Mask

## Kitty Mask

To draw a kitty on github commit history calendar.

![sample](https://github.com/bw1332/GitHubKittyMask/raw/master/cat.jpg)

The script is very simple. 
It fakes contributions in old days.


Before running the script, make sure github SSH key has been set correctly. So you don't have to input your user name and password.

The kitty will disappear after removing the repository.

Just for fun!
